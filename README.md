# improve-performance

The project contains a service called NumberService. The method in test is findSmallestDuplicate, which accepts a List<String> and returns a number if there's a duplicate or 0 if there are no duplicates. 
  
Implement the findSmallestDuplicateImproved method so that the unit test passes. There are two conditions: 
1. The number that the new method finds is the same as the slow running method (findSmallestDuplicate)
2. The new method is at least 10 times faster than the old one.
